## Challenge Description: 
     We are given a file (`data.dat`) containing multiple lines of binary numbers (composed of 0's and 1's).  
     Our task is to count how many lines satisfy at least one of the following conditions:
       1- The number of `0`s in the line is a multiple of 3.
       2- The number of `1`s in the line is a multiple of 2.
----
## Code snippet
  ```python
cnt = 0
with open("data.dat") as f:
    for l in f.readlines():
        if l.count('0') % 3 == 0 or l.count('1') % 2 == 0:
            cnt += 1
print(cnt)
---
## Analysis Steps:
  ### Open the given file data.dat 
        For each line:
           Count the number of 0s and check if it's divisible by 3.
           Count the number of 1s and check if it's divisible by 2.
        If either condition is true, increase the counter.
        Print the total count — this number is the flag.
  ### The result : 6662
---
### The flag: 6662
